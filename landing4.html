										<h2>Projects</h2>
									</header>
									<p>During my Master of Science in Computer Science (Data Science) at USC, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of academic projects that challenged me and expanded my knowledge in the field. These projects allowed me to apply the concepts I learned in the classroom to real-world situations, and collaborate with classmates from diverse backgrounds. The program's focus on both theoretical and practical aspects of data science equipped me with a well-rounded skill set. I am grateful for the hands-on experience and the chance to work on cutting-edge technologies, and I am confident that the education I received at USC has set me up for success in my future endeavors.</p>

												<h3>Kernel Programming on Weenix OS</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The CSCI 402 Operating Systems course at USC included a series of challenging kernel assignments which involved the implementation of various parts of a Weenix-based operating system. These assignments provided hands-on experience in operating system design and implementation. The assignments covered topics such as processes and threads, VFS layer and virtual memory and were implemented using C programming language and various debugging tools. These assignments helped students to gain valuable knowledge in system calls, process management, memory management, and file systems, as well as develop problem-solving skills and an understanding of the inner workings of an operating system. This experience was a great addition to students portfolio and would be beneficial for their future endeavors.</p>

												<h3>Emulation Based Distributed File System</h3>
											</header>
                                            <P>The EDFS (Emulation Based Distributed File System) project was developed and tested using a large crime database from Los Angeles, containing over 5 million records and 50 GB of data. The goal of the project was to improve the efficiency of data retrieval. Python libraries such as pymysql, base64, streamlit, and numpy were utilized to implement the EDFS system. Streamlit was chosen as the front-end framework for its simplicity and ease of use compared to other frameworks like Django. As a result, the project achieved a 50% increase in data retrieval speed. The use of Streamlit allowed for an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easier for non-technical users to access the data stored in the EDFS.</P><ul class="actions">

												<h3>Kaggle Project for CSCI 567: Machine Learning</h3>
											</header>
                                           <P>As part of the CSCI 567 Machine Learning course at USC, a Kaggle competition was conducted with the objective of forecasting store sales using time series data. The dataset, which was obtained from this link "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting", involved challenging time series data pertaining to store sales. The competition involved competing with other class teams to achieve the best public score on Kaggle. Various machine learning algorithms were applied such as decision trees, and regression techniques like Ridge, Random Forest, Linear and XGBRegressor to develop the model. In the final model, the best outputs were stacked together from different algorithms, which resulted in high accuracy and a final public score of 0.38212. This score placed the team among the top 10 in the class, and first for the mid-term submission of the same when the public score was 0.39101.</P><ul class="actions">
